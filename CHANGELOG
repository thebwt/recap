0.7
	-Added flag to perform snapshots. A snapshot is a one-time report that generates time-stamped output files. These files are not included in the output file rotation
	-Added flag to perform a backup of the latest reports. There was an issue on some servers where the second "@reboot" command would not be executed from cron. This creates a time-stamped copy (similar to the snapshots above, but labeled "backup") of the latest set of report files
	-Wrapped almost all functionality in bash functions to allow for more flexible execution of rs-sysmon functionality. This is still a mess and will continue to be addressed in future releases.
0.8
	-Modified the send_mail function so that it generates a random tmp directory to use rather than always writing to the same location
0.8-2
